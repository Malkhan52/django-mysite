BUY Recommendation Report 

Hawkins Cooker (HWK)

Overview
Hawkinsÿmakes pressure cookers and cookware. It is a high-quality company and consistently reports a 45% return on equity and about 7% growth in sales. More than 80% of its sales comes from pressure cookers. It is the market leader in the product, making 12 types of them. 

ProfitUNO Score
Based on Value Assessment model we give Hawkins Cooker a score of 4 on a 5 point scale.

 




Highlights
TheÿHawkinsÿbrand is valuable, as shown in its ability to price its premium pressure cooker (Futura) at 2.5 to 3 times the price of its value pressure cookers (Classic and Miss Mary). The company has also hiked its prices 4% to 7% in past years, without decline in sales.

Valuation
The current share price is Rs 2,940. Even if we give it a 15-year long runway to grow, in our opinion,ÿHawkinsÿmust grow at least 16% every year to justify the valuation. That is a stretch, given its average growth of only 7% (lowest 4%, highest 12%) in the last 5 years.
